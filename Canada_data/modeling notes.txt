project 5 observations:

modeling:
cap looks like 40% any more than that and your model 
becomes more overfit and more computationaly heavy

most models with get ~15 - 20 % using defalut params

can get over 40 but is completly overfit with the train being 99% in those cases


nn looks like the best with compensating for overfit:

using just temp in best params had a strong reduction in acuracy.
reduced by  almost 20 points or 50% less effective.

using PCA lowered the accuracy of the model too.
